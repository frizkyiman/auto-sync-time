# auto-sync-time

Usage:
To synchronize the system time, simply run the script in the terminal and provide the desired URL or IP address as an argument. For example:
```
./sync_time.sh bug.com

```

If no argument is provided, it will use "google.com" as the default time server:
```
./sync_time.sh
```
